# Image processing via Fourier Transform (FT)

### Goal 
- Implement two versions of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).
- Extend the FFT algorithm to multidimensional case (2-dimensions in this lab)
- Use FFT to denoise an image
- Use FFT to compress an image file

One of them will be a brute force approach that follows directly from the formula. 

The second one will be an implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which follows a divide-and-conquer approach to algorithm design. In particular, the FFT we will focus on is the Cooley-Tukey FFT.
